            <h5>What is Polimatk?</h5>
            <p>
                While it started as a manager for debates over Discord, Polimatk quickly became a
                one-size-fits-all bot. With unparalleled customization and an elegant design,
                it has become one of the most inuitive and feature-rich streaming tools. We hope
                to continue to innovate in this area for all kinds of communities.

            <h5>Get started</h5>
            <p>
                Get started by clicking
                <a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Sign in with Discord</a> and choose
                <a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Add to my server</a> so it will join.
                Then, set up your profile and you're good to go!

            <h5>Prefixes</h5>
            <p>
                Commands support any or no prefix &mdash; when creating a command, it will default
                to <code>!</code>, which can be changed or removed entirely. Add or modify a
                command by clicking its name, then click outside of the text box to save it.
                Confirm your choice if no prefix was provided.
            </p>

            <h5>Variables</h5>
            <p>
                Commands support variables, and we're always looking to add more. Currently
                supported variables:
                <h6 class="mt-4"><code>{user id}</code></h6>
                The sender's Discord ID. Example: <strong>45428968096324</strong>
                <h6 class="mt-4"><code>{user name}</code></h6>
                The sender's Discord name. Example: <strong>Polimatk</strong>
                <h6 class="mt-4"><code>{user fullname}</code></h6>
                The sender's Discord name and identifier. Example: <strong>Polimatk#1337</strong>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h5>Custom APIs</h5>
            <p>
                Want to extend the features of this bot? Commands also support custom APIs. To
                make a request, add the following where you'd like the response to go:
                <h6 class="mt-4"><code>{api https://api.polima.tk/autoupdate.txt}</code></h6>
                Use for plain-text responses, e.g. you want a command that updates automatically.
                <h6 class="mt-4"><code>{api https://api.polima.tk/v1/weather?q={args} weather.description}</code></h6>
                For JSON responses, provide the path to the text you want. For multiple texts,
                include the entire {api } block again &mdash; the response will be cached
                so your API key will not be used twice.
